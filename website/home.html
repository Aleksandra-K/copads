		<p align="justify">The main aim of
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/copads">COPADS</a> is to develop a 
compilation of of Python data structures and its algorithms, making it almost a 
purely developmental project. Personally, I look at this as a re-usable 
collection of tools that I can use in other projects. Therefore, this project is 
essentially &quot;needs-driven&quot;, except a core subset of data structures and 
algorithms. </p>
		<p align="justify">This project originated from 3 threads of thought. 
		Firstly, while browsing through Mehta and Sahni's
		<span id="btAsinTitle" style><u>Handbook of Data Structures and 
		Applications</u>, I thought there might be utility to have a number of 
		the listed data structures implemented in Python. Given my interest in 
		biological data management, having a good set of data structures is 
		always handy. The 2nd thread of thought came from <u>Numerical Recipes</u>. 
		Again, I thought these algorithms will be handy to have and had started 
		to translate some of them into Python during some overly energetic days. 
		Finally, <u>Python Cookbook</u> had undergone 2 editions by 2008 and 
		ActiveState had provided an online platform for Python Recipes which I 
		found to be useful and can see how some of these recipes can be merged. 
		Thus, COPADS is borned.</span></p>
